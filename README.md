 In this example, we use the Plotly library to create a bar chart with dummy data. We started by creating lists of labels and values ​​to represent our data. Next, we use the "Bar" class from the Plotly library to create an object that represents our bar chart.  Then, we create a "Layout" object to define the title of the chart and the X and Y axis labels. Finally, we use the "Figure" function to create the chart figure, passing our object "data" and "layout" as parameters . We render the plot into an HTML file using the "plot" function from the Plotly "offline" library.  This script can be used as a template for creating other bar charts with the Plotly library by simply modifying the label and value lists and adjusting the title and axis labels as needed.
